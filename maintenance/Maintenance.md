If afterwards the component is de installed nothing shall be left and remind of RSGallery2

(2) Remove RSGallery2 tables and images

Instead of using this function  begin with above function 'Purge tables (data)'
See following instruction for a complete remove

### How to remove RSGALLERY2 completely

This removes the database content and the image files

(2) Prepare the remove of database table structure

Search in admin rsgallery2 folder \administrator\components\com_rsgallery2\sql\ for file uninstall.mysql.utf8.sql. Edit the file and remove the comments in front of the drop commands.

Use finally standard Joomla uninstall to get rid of all parts of RSGallery2
